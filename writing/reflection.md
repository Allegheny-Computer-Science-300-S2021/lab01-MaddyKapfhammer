## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)

1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
   `GWAS is often used to associate specific genetic variations with specific diseases. It is used in medical fields and research to identify genetic connections to disease.`
2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
   `Genome Wide Association Studies often involves investigating the genomes from huge datasets of organisms (often humans). Through this analysis, genetic markers connected to disease are discovered, and then used to predict the presence of a disease. GWAS analysis focuses on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occur throughout DNA. SNPs are responsible for genetic variations indicating the biological markers of disease. `
3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
   `GWAS is essential to understanding disease evolution and history. Understanding the genetic markers that are connected to disease provide the opportunity to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.`
4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method or tool? `Hand in hand with GWAS comes statistics, which help to significantly determine a relationship between genetic markers and disease. "False positives" indicating a relationship when there is none are possible if statistics are not done carefully. Undesirable use of Genome Wide Association Studies could provide information allowing individuals to manipulate the genetic markers related to disease and increase the risk of development or transmission among laboratory subjects. It is possible that GWAS could be used to increase disease effects, rather than developing treatments which causes ethical concerns.`

### Metagenomics

1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
   `Metagenomics includes the study of genetic materials that are recovered from the environment rather than silico virus sequencing. This type of research is often used in the field of microbiology to produce a genetic profile from a natural sample, which are often more accessible.`
2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
   In metagenomics, gentic material is retrieved from a direct sample from a contaminated (or interest) site. Rather than amplifying for certain genes, the entire genome of a microbial community is sequenced and analyzed. This technique provides wholistic information which is cost-effective and simple to perform and understand.`
3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
   `Metagenomics gives an insight into the microbial communities that are essential for all life on Earth. Rather than selecting certain genetic material to focus on, this method provides a more comprehensive approach which can allow us to understand microbes and their diverse functionality. While genomics is an important aspect of microbiology, most microbes are not able to be cultured; metagenomics gives the scientific community an opportunity to investigate the microbes which effect much of Earth's and life's processes.`
4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool? `Often it is possible that DNA fragments and unknown sequences can be discovered when dealing in metagenomics. This could lead to confusion and possible unsupported scientific claims. With the unknowns that come with metagenomics, it is possible that misinformation can be easily spread through databases and libraries on genetic information and microbial communities. `
